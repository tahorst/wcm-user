Scripts to explore adding additional kinetics data to metabolism.  Currently have 1271 constraints annotated but only use 431 of them.

Requires:
- data/raw_data.cp
- data/sim_data.cp

Tested with raw_data.cp and sim_data.cp from parca output files in out/manual/kb/ (rawData.cPickle and simData.cPickle) on range-kinetics branch (27a6332821) branched from edd286050e with the addition of metabolism_kinetics.tsv flat file.
